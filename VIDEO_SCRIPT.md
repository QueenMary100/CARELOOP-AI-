1:40–2:20 — Demo the value (40s)

2:20–3:00 — Closing (40s)
- Why this should win: clarity, impact, demoable results, and global relevance.
- Call to action: "See our GitHub / Try the demo" and invite judges to ask for the technical appendix.

Notes:
- Keep visuals clear, use callouts/zoom for key screens.
- Speak plainly — judges prefer simple, human stories + crisp demo steps.
