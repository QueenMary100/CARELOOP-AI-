Project name: CareLoop_Ai

Short description (1–2 sentences):
AI-powered daily wellbeing check-ins that detect risk signals and deliver human-friendly advice and optional family/caregiver alerts.

Problem:
Millions of people lack simple, scalable ways to recognize early signs of mental health decline. Existing apps are heavy and not designed for early, daily micro-checks.

Solution:
2-minute daily check-ins (text/voice), lightweight AI scoring to surface risk signals, time-series insights and optional trusted-contact alerts.

Tech stack:
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Framer Motion
- Backend: Supabase Functions (or mock server for demo)
- AI: Prompt-based lightweight scoring (or small model)
